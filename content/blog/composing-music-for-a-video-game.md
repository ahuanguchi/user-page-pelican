Title: Composing music for a video game
Category: Music

Over the last week, I've had the opportunity to help NomnomNami compose music for her NaNoRenO 2016 game! She'll release it by the end of the month, but until then, you can follow her progress on her [dev blog](http://nomnomnamidev.tumblr.com) and play some of her [other games](https://nomnomnami.itch.io).

Also, you can now find me on Twitter at [@LydianChord](https://twitter.com/LydianChord). I figured I should have some sort of social media handle for things like this, and fortunately I was able to choose a fitting name that hasn't been taken!
