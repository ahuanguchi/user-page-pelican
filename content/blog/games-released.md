Title: Games released
Category: Music

NomnomNami has released Her Tears Were My Light, the game that I helped write the soundtrack for! You can get the game [here](https://nomnomnami.itch.io/her-tears-were-my-light) and the soundtrack [here](https://lydianchord.bandcamp.com/album/her-tears-were-my-light-soundtrack).

I made my own NaNoRenO game too, which you can find [here](https://alexh.itch.io/abandoned-building-quest). I also wrote the [soundtrack](https://lydianchord.bandcamp.com/album/abandoned-building-quest-soundtrack), which is probably more enjoyable than the game itself unless you're a masochist.

Have fun!
