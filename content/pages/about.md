Title: About

![chords.png]({filename}/images/chords.png)

I'm currently a research assistant at a music cognition lab, and I'm also a programming enthusiast. At work, this usually means I can make use of my Python scripts to automate tasks like sound file creation, file system operations, data cleaning, and code generation (for more limited languages like Inquisit). I also do front-end and back-end coding for our online experiments. In my free time, I compose music, and I use my programming skills to create websites, games, web apps (including music-related apps), and simple web browsing utilities. I primarily code in Python and JavaScript, but I also have experience in other languages. You can find links to some of my personal projects and read my blog on this site.
