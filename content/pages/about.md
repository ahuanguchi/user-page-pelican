Title: About

![chords.png]({filename}/images/chords.png)

I'm currently a research assistant at a music cognition lab, and I'm also a programming enthusiast. At work, this usually means I can make use of my Python scripts to automate tasks like sound file creation, filesystem operations, data cleaning, and code generation (for less expressive languages like Inquisit). However, in my free time, I also like to use my programming skills to create websites, games, web apps (including music-related apps), and simple web browsing utilities. I primarily code in Python and JavaScript, but I also dabble in other languages. You can find links to some of my personal projects and read my blog on this site.
